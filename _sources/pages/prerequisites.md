# Prerequisites

For a smooth experience during the ICWSM tutorial, please ensure you have the following prerequisites set up beforehand. We have tried to provide clear and easy-to-follow instructions to make the process as straightforward as possible. 

## üë®‚Äçüíª Reddit API

1. **Create a Reddit Account**: You will need a Reddit account to access the Reddit API. If you don't have one already, head over to [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/) and sign up for a new account.

2. **Register as a Developer**: Follow [Reddit's API guide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/) to [register as a developer](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=14868593862164). This step is necessary to create a script app and obtain the required credentials for API access.

3. **Create a Script App**: Once registered as a developer, create a [script app](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). This will provide you with the `PUBLIC_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` credentials needed to authenticate with the Reddit API during the tutorial.

## üì¶ Supabase API

1. **Sign Up for Supabase**: Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up for a new account. This will allow you to create a project and obtain the necessary credentials for storing the Reddit data.

2. **Create a New Project**: After signing up, create a new project in Supabase. This will generate a database `URL` and a `SECRET_KEY` (`service_role`) for your project.

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment Setup

1. **Install Visual Studio Code (Recommended)**: We recommend [installing Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a popular and user-friendly code editor. Once installed, make sure to get the Python extension for full support in running and editing Python apps.

   Alternatively, you can use your preferred code editor or IDE, but please note that Jupyter Notebook is not the ideal workspace for running RedditHarbor.

2. **Install Python**: Install a supported version of Python on your system:
   - **Windows**: [Install Python from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Use the "Download Python" button that appears first on the page to download the latest version.
   - **macOS**: The system install of Python on macOS is not supported. Instead, we recommend using a package management system like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). To install Python using Homebrew on macOS, run `brew install python3` in the Terminal.

3. **Install Python Extension (for Visual Studio Code users)**: If you're using Visual Studio Code, open the editor and navigate to the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`). Search for "python" in the Extensions Marketplace and install the Python extension.

## üî£ Command Prompt (Windows Users)

If you're a Windows user, we recommend using Git Bash, one of the best command prompts for a Linux-style command-line experience. Follow these steps:

1. [Download Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. Follow the setup wizard, selecting all the default options
3. At the "Adjusting your PATH environment" step, select the "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" option
4. Once installed, you will have access to Git Bash, which provides Linux-style command-line utilities and Git functionality in Windows.

If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties during the setup process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to ensure a smooth and enjoyable tutorial experience for everyone.
